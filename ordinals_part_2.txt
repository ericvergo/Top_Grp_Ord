\subsection{Topology of homeomorphism groups}

Though our focus is on homeomorphism groups as abstract groups, a key subgroup in what follows is defined by taking a closure in an appropriate topology on the homeomorphism group of an ordinal.  

\begin{Def}[Permutation topology]
For an ordinal \( \alpha \), the \emph{permutation topology} on the group \( \Homeo(\alpha+1) \) is generated by the sets of the form \( U(A,B) = \{ h \in \Homeo(\alpha) : h(A) = B \} \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are clopen subsets of \( \alpha +1 \). 
\end{Def}

The permutation topology is motivated by the model theory perspective and arises from the identification, via Stone duality, of \( \Homeo(\alpha+1) \) with the automorphism group of the Boolean algebra given by the clopen subsets of \( \alpha+1 \). 
It is an exercise to show that that the permutation topology agrees with the compact-open topology, that is, the topology generated by sets of the form \( U(K,W) = \{h\in \Homeo(\alpha + 1) : h(K) \subset W \} \), where \( K \) is compact and \( W \) is open in \( \alpha  + 1 \). 
A theorem of Arens \cite{ArensTopologies}---which the reader may treat as an exercise---tells us that the homeomorphism group of a compact Hausdorff space equipped with the compact-open topology is a topological group.
From this discussion, we record the following.

\begin{Prop}
For any ordinal \( \alpha \), the group \( \Homeo(\alpha+1) \) equipped with the permutation topology is a topological group.

\section{Cantor--Bendixson degree one}

Throughout this section, we study \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) instead of \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}+1) \), but recall they are isomorphic by \Cref{lem:isomorphism}. 

Before beginning, let us recall two standard definitions.
Let \( X \) be a topological space. 
A family of subset \( \{ Y_n \}_{n\in\bn} \) of \( X \) is \emph{locally finite} if, given any compact set \( K \), the cardinality of the set \( \{ n\in \bn : K \cap Y_n \neq \varnothing \} \) is finite. 
The \emph{support} of a homeomorphism \( f \co X \to X \) is the closure of the set \( \{  x \in X : f(x) \neq x \} \). 
Given a sequence \( \{ f_n \}_{n\in\bn} \) of homeomorphisms \( X \to X \) whose supports form a locally finite family of pairwise-disjoint sets, the infinite product of the \( f _n \), denoted \( \prod_{n\in\bn} f_n \), is the homeomorphism that agrees with \( f_n \) on the support of \( f_n \) for each \( n \in \bn \) and restricts to the identity elsewhere. 
In the compact-open topology on \( \Homeo(X) \), the infinite product can be realized as the limit of the finite products, that is, \( \prod_{n\in\bn} f_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \prod_{k=1}^n f_k \). 


\subsection{Topological moieties}

A moiety in the natural numbers refers to a subset that has the same cardinality as its complement.  
We extend the definition to ordinals of the form \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \). 

\begin{Def}
A subset \( A \) of \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \) is a \emph{topological moiety} if \( A \) is clopen and both \( A \) and \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \ssm A \) contain infinitely many rank \( \alpha +1 \) points. 
\end{Def}

We will require several properties of moieties.  

\begin{Prop}
\label{prop:moieties same}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal.
Every topological moiety of \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \) is homeomorphic to \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \).
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
Let \( A \) be a moiety of \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \).
Then \( A \), equipped with the order inherited from \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \), is a well-ordered set, and hence order isomorphic to an ordinal. 
Let \( \{a_n\}_{n\in\bn} \) be an enumeration of the maximal rank elements of \( A \) such that \( a_n < a_m \) whenever \( n < m \). 
Let \( U_1 = [0, a_1] \cap A \), and let \( U_n = [a_{n-1}+1, a_n] \cap A \) for \( n > 1 \). 
Then \( \{U_n\}_{n\in\bn} \) is a collection of pairwise-disjoint clopen subsets satisfying \( A = \bigcup_{n\in\bn} U_n \), implying that \( A \) is homeomorphic to the topological disjoint union of the \( A_n \). 
Now, by the classification of successor ordinals (\Cref{thm:classification}), each of the \( U_n \) is homeomorphic to \( \omega^\alpha + 1 \); therefore, \( A \) is homeomorphic to \( \bn \times (\omega^\alpha+1) \), which is in turn homeomorphic to \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \) by \Cref{prop:coordinates}. 
\end{proof}

\Cref{prop:moieties same} yields the following ``change of coordinates principle''. 

\begin{Lem}
\label{lem:change of coordinates}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal.
If \( A \) and \( B \) are topological moieties, then there exists \( \sigma \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) such that \( \sigma(A) = B \).
Moreover, if \( A \cap B = \varnothing \), then \( \sigma \) can be chosen to be an involution supported in \( A \cup B \). 
\end{Lem}

\begin{proof}
By \Cref{prop:moieties same}, there exists a homeomorphism \( f \co A \to B \). 
Let \( C \) and \( D \) the complements of \( A \) and \( B \), respectively.
And as the complement of a topological moiety is a topological moiety, there exists a homeomorphism \( g\co C \to D \).
Define \( \sigma \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) such that \( \sigma|_A = f \) and \( \sigma|_C = g \).
Then \( \sigma(A) = B \). 

Now suppose that \( A \cap B = \varnothing \).
Define \( \iota \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) by 
\[
	\iota(x) = \left\{
		\begin{array}{ll}
			f(x)		& \text{if } x \in A \\
			f^{-1}(x) 	& \text{if } x \in B \\
			x		& \text{otherwise}
		\end{array}
	\right.
\]
Then \( \iota \) is an involution supported in \( A\cup B \) mapping \( A \) onto \( B \). 
\end{proof}

To finish this subsection, we need to establish the existence of a homeomorphism that will translate a topological moiety off of itself. 

\begin{Def}
Given a topological moiety \( A \) in \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \), we call \( \vp \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) an \( A \)-translation if \( \vp^n(A) \cap \vp^m(A) = \varnothing \) for all \( n,m \in \bz \). 
If, in addition, \( \{ \vp^n(A) \}_{n\in\bz} \) is locally finite, then we say that \( \vp \) is a \emph{convergent \( A \)-translation}. 
\end{Def}

\begin{Lem}
\label{lem:translation}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal.
If \( A \) is a topological moiety in \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \), then there exists a convergent \( A \)-translation in \( \vp \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \). 
Moreover, \( \vp \) can be chosen to be supported in a topological moiety. 
\end{Lem}

\begin{proof}
By \Cref{prop:coordinates}, \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \) is homeomorphic to \( \bn \times (\omega^\alpha +1) \), which in turn is homeomorphic to \( \bz \times \bn^2 \times (\omega^\alpha +1) \).
Consider the subset \( A' \) of the latter space given by \( A' = \{ 0 \} \times \{ 1 \} \times \bn \times (\omega^\alpha+1) \).
Define \( \tau' \) by \( \tau'(\ell, 1,n,x) = (\ell+1,1, n, x) \) and \( \tau'(\ell, m ,n , x) = ( \ell, m ,n , x) \) whenever \( m > 1\). 
Fix a homeomorphism \( \psi \co  \bz \times \bn^2 \times (\omega^\alpha +1) \to  \omega^{\alpha+1} \). 
Then \( \psi(A') \) is a topological moiety, and by \Cref{lem:change of coordinates}, we can assume that \( \psi(A') = A \).
It follows that \( \vp = \psi \circ \tau'\circ \psi^{-1} \) is a convergent \( A \)-translation.
Moreover, as \( \tau' \) is supported in \( \bz \times \{1 \} \times \bn \times (\omega^\alpha + 1) \), we have that \( \tau \) is supported in a topological moiety. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Galvin's lemma}

The key behind all the proofs in the remainder of the section is a uniform fragmentation result, i.e., given two topological moieties whose union is a topological moiety, we provide a way of writing any homeomorphism as a composition of three homeomorphisms each of which is supported in one of the two given moieties. 
We call this uniform fragmentation result Galvin's lemma, as it is an extension of Galvin's \cite[Lemma~2.1]{GalvinGenerating} from the setting of permutation groups to \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \).
Given a topological moiety \( A \) of \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \), we let \[ F_A = \{ f \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) : f(a) = a \text{ for all } a \in A\}. \] 


\begin{Prop}[Galvin's lemma for ordinals]
\label{prop:galvin}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( A \) and \( B \) be disjoint topological moieties in \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \). 
If \( A \cup B \) is a topological moiety, then \[ \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) = F_AF_BF_A \cup F_BF_AF_B. \] 
\end{Prop}

\begin{proof}
Fix \( h \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha +1}) \). 
Let \( C \) denote the complement of \( A \cup B \). 
As \[ C = (C \ssm h(A)) \cup (C \ssm h(B)), \] at least one of \( C \ssm h(A) \) or \( C \ssm h(B) \) is a topological moiety. 
First, suppose that \( C \ssm h(A) \) is a topological moiety. 
We can then write \( C = M_1 \cup M_2 \), where \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) are disjoint topological moieties and \( h(A) \cap C \subset M_1 \). 
By \Cref{lem:change of coordinates}, it is possible to choose \( f_1 \in F_A \) such that \( f_1(B \cup M_1) = C \) and \( f_1(M_2) = B \). 

Observe that \( (f_1\circ h)(A) \) is contained in \( A \cup C \) and is disjoint from a moiety contained in \( C \). 
It follows that there exists \( f_2 \in F_B \) such that \( f_2(f_1(h(A))) = A \). 
Therefore, \( f_2 \circ f_1 \circ h = f_3 \circ f_4 \), where \( f_3 \) is supported in \( A \) and \( f_4 \) is supported in the complement of \( A \). 
So, 
\[ 
	h = f_1^{-1} \circ (f_2^{-1} \circ f_3) \circ f_4,
\]
with \( f_1^{-1}, f_4 \in F_A \) and \( f_2^{-1}, f_3 \in F_B \), implying \( h \in F_A F_B F_A \). 

As noted above, if \( C \ssm h(A) \) is not a topological moiety, then \( C \ssm h(B) \) must be a topological moiety.
In this case, a similar argument establishes that \( h \in F_B F_A F_B \). 
\end{proof}


\subsection{Normal generation and uniform perfectness}


We now turn to (1) showing that \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) is a uniformly perfect group and (2) classifying the normal generators of of \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \).  

Let us recall several definitions. 
A group \( G \) is \emph{perfect} if it is equal to its commutator subgroup, i.e., the subgroup generated by the set \( \{ [x,y] : x,y \in G \} \), where \( [x,y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \); it is \emph{uniformly perfect} if there exists some \( k \in \bn \) such that every element of \( G \) can be expressed as a product of \( k \) commutators, and the minimum such \( k \) is called the \emph{commutator width} of \( G \).  

\begin{Lem}
\label{lem:commutator}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( h \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \).
If \( h \) is supported in a topological moiety, then \( h \) can be expressed as a single commutator. 
\end{Lem}

\begin{proof}
Let \( A \) be a topological moiety that contains the support of \( h \). 
By \Cref{lem:translation}, there exists a convergent \( A \)-translation \( \tau \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \). 
We now apply a standard commutator trick. 
Setting \( \sigma = \prod_{n=0}^\infty (\tau^n \circ h \circ \tau^{-n}) \), it is readily checked that \( h = [\sigma, \tau] \).  
\end{proof}


\begin{Thm}
	\label{thm:mainthm2}
	If \( \alpha \) is an ordinal, then \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) is uniformly perfect, and the commutator width is at most three. 
\end{Thm}

\begin{proof}
Let \( h \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \). 
By \Cref{prop:galvin}, \( h = h_1 h_2 h_3 \), with \( h_i \) supported in a topological moiety. 
By \Cref{lem:commutator}, \( h_i \) is a commutator, and hence, \( h \) can be expressed as a product of three commutators. 
\end{proof}


Recall that an element \( g \) in a group \( G \) is a \emph{normal generator} if every element of \( G \) can be expressed as a product of conjugates of \( g \) and \( g^{-1} \), or equivalently, \( G \) is the smallest normal subgroup containing \( g \).
The element \( g \) is a \emph{uniform normal generator} if there exists \( k \in \bn \) such that every element of \( G \) can be expressed as a product of at most \( k \) conjugates of \( g \) and \( g^{-1} \); the \emph{\( g \)-width} of \( G \) is the minimum such \( k \). 

To classify normal generators, we use a technique that goes back to at least the work of Anderson \cite{AndersonAlgebraic}.
As with uniform perfectness, we first investigate writing a homeomorphism supported in a moiety as a bounded-length product of conjugates of a given element and its inverse; we can then use Galvin's lemma to upgrade this to express any element in the same form. 


\begin{Prop}[Anderson's method for ordinals]
\label{prop:anderson}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( h \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \).
If there exists a topological moiety \( A \) such that \( h(A) \cap A = \varnothing \), then each element of \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) supported in a topological moiety can be expressed as product of four conjugates of \( h \) and \( h^{-1} \). 
\end{Prop}


\begin{proof}
Let \( f \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) such that \( f \) is supported in a moiety. 
Let \( A \) be a topological moiety such that \( h(A) \cap A  = \varnothing \), and let \( B \) be a submoiety of \( A \). 
By \Cref{lem:change of coordinates}, up to conjugating \( f \), we may assume that \( f \) is supported in \( B \). 
\Cref{prop:moieties same} and \Cref{lem:translation} imply the existence of  a convergent \( B \)-translation \( \tau \) supported in \( A \). 
Define \( \psi \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) by

\[
\psi(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
h(x)  &   \text{if } x \in A  \\
(\tau \circ h^{-1})(x) & \text{if } x \in h(A) \\
x & \text{otherwise}
\end{array}\right.
\]

Let \( \sigma = \prod_{n=0}^\infty (\tau^n \circ f \circ \tau^{-n}) \), and let \( \eta =[\sigma, h] \). 
Then one can check that \[ f = \eta \circ \psi \circ \eta \circ \psi^{-1}. \]
Informally, one sees this by noting that \( \sigma \) is ``performing \( f \) on all the forward iterates of \( B \) in A'', and hence so is \( \eta \), but \( \eta \) is also ``performing \( f^{-1} \) on all the forward iterates of \( h(B) \) in \( h(A) \)''. 
Now, \( \psi \circ \eta \circ \psi^{-1} \) restricts to the inverse of \( \eta \) on the complement of \( B \) and is the identity on \( B \) (this is on account of \( \psi|_{h(A)} = \tau \circ h^{-1} |_{h(A)} \)).
Therefore, the composition \( \eta \circ (\psi \circ \eta \circ \psi^{-1}) \) is supported on \( B \), where it agrees with \( \sigma \) and hence with \( f \). 

Expanding out the above formulation of \( f \), we have:
\begin{align*}
	f 	&= \eta \circ \psi \circ \eta \circ \psi^{-1} \\
		&= \sigma \circ h \circ \sigma^{-1} \circ h^{-1} \circ \psi \circ \sigma \circ h \circ \sigma^{-1} \circ h^{-1} \circ \psi^{-1} \\
		&= (\sigma \circ h \circ \sigma^{-1}) \circ (h^{-1}) \circ (\psi \circ \sigma \circ h \circ \sigma^{-1} \circ \psi^{-1}) \circ (\psi \circ h^{-1} \circ \psi^{-1}),
\end{align*}
implying that \( f \) can be expressed as a product of four conjugates of \( h \) and \( h^{-1} \). 
\end{proof}


\begin{Cor}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( h \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \).
If there exists a topological moiety \( A \) such that \( h(A) \cap A = \varnothing \), then \( h \) uniformly normally generates \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) and the \( h \)-width of \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) is at most twelve. 
\end{Cor}

\begin{proof}
By \Cref{prop:galvin}, each element of \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) can be expressed as a composition of three homeomorphisms each of which is supported in a topological moiety.
Therefore, by \Cref{prop:anderson}, each element of \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) can be expressed as a composition of twelve homeomorphisms each of which is a conjugate of \( h \) or \( h^{-1} \). 
\end{proof}


We have established the existence of uniform normal generators for \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \), but we have yet to classify all such homeomorphisms.
To do so, we will show that if a homeomorphism induces an infinite permutation of the maximal rank  elements (i.e., the rank \( \alpha+1 \) elements), then it must move some moiety off itself, implying it is a uniform normal generator. 
The elements inducing a finite permutation on the rank \( \alpha+1 \) elements is a proper normal subgroup, and hence this will yield a complete classification of the normal generators. 


\begin{Lem}
\label{lem:displacement}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( h \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \). 
If \( h \) induces an infinite permutation on the set of rank \( \alpha + 1 \) elements of \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \), then there exists a moiety \( A \) such that \( h(A) \cap A = \varnothing \) and \( A \cup h(A) \) is a moiety. 
\end{Lem}

\begin{proof}
Choose a rank \( \alpha + 1 \) point \( a_1 \) such that \( h(a_1) \neq a_1 \). 
By continuity, there exists a clopen neighborhood \( A_1 \) of \( a_1 \) such that \( a_1 \) is the unique rank \( \alpha + 1 \) element of \( A_1 \) and such that  \( h(A_1) \cap A_1 = \varnothing \). 
Next, choose \( a_2 \) in the complement of \( A_1 \cup h(A_1) \cup h^{-1}(A_1) \) such that \( h(a_2) \neq a_2 \), which is possible as \( h \) induces an infinite permutation on the set of rank \( \alpha \) points. 
Again by continuity, we can choose a clopen neighborhood \( A_2 \) of \( a_2 \) in the complement of \( A_1 \cup h(A_1) \cup h^{-1}(A_1) \) such that \( h(A_2) \cap A_2 = \varnothing \). 
In particular, \( h(A_1) \cap A_2 = \varnothing \) and \( h(A_2) \cap A_1 = \varnothing \).
Proceeding in this fashion, we construct a sequence of clopen sets \( \{ A_n \}_{n\in\bn} \), each containing a unique rank \( \alpha + 1 \) point, such that \( h(A_i) \cap A_j = \varnothing \) for all \( i,j \in \bn \). 
Let \( A = \bigcup_{n\in\bn} A_{2n} \). 
Then, by construction, \( A \) is a moiety, \( h(A) \cup A \) is a moiety, and \( h(A) \cap A = \varnothing \). 
\end{proof} 

\begin{Thm}
\label{thm:normal generators 1}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal. 
For \( h \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \), the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item \( h \) normally generates   \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \).
\item \( h \) uniformly normally generates \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \).
\item \( h \) induces an infinite permutation of the set of maximal rank elements of \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \). 
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, if any of the above conditions are satisfied, then the \( h \)-width of \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) is at most twelve. 
\end{Thm}


\begin{proof}
It is clear that (ii) implies (i) and that (i) implies (iii). 
Now, we assume (iii), that is, \( h \) induces an infinite permutation of the set of \( \alpha \) rank points of \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \).
In this case, \Cref{lem:displacement}, implies there exists a moiety \( A \) such that \( h(A) \cap A = \varnothing \).
By \Cref{prop:anderson}, every homeomorphism supported in a topological moiety is a product of four conjugates of \( h \) and \( h^{-1} \).
We can then apply \Cref{prop:galvin} to conclude that every element of \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) is a product of twelve conjugates of \( h \) and \( h^{-1} \), establishing that (iii) implies (ii).
\end{proof}




\subsection{Strong distortion}

Recall that a group \( G \) is \emph{strongly distorted} if there exists \( m \in \bn \) and a sequence \( \{w_n\}_{n\in\bn} \subset \bn \) such that for any sequence \( \{ g_n\}_{n\in\bn} \subset G \) there exists \( S \subset G \) of cardinality at most \( m \) such that \( g_n \in S^{w_n} \). 
The notion of strong distortion was introduced by Calegari--Freedman \cite{CalegariDistortion}, and they provide a technique for establishing strong distortion that we employ here. 
This technique was described in a general form by Le Roux--Mann \cite[Construction~2.3]{LeRouxStrong} that we rephrase here in the context of ordinals. 
Below, and throughout the rest of the article, given \( g, h \in G \), we let \( g^h = h g h^{-1} \). 

\begin{Prop}
\label{prop:construction}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( \{h_n\}_{n\in\bn} \) be a sequence in \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) such that \( h_n \) is supported in a topological moiety \( A \).
If \( \sigma \) is a convergent \( A \)-translation supported in a topological moiety \( B \) and if \( \tau \) is a convergent \( B \)-translation, then 
\[ 
	\vp = \prod_{n,m \in \omega} h_n^{\tau^n\sigma^m} 
\]
exists and is a homeomorphism, and  
\[ 
	h_n = [\vp^{\tau^{-n}}, \sigma]. 
\]
\qed
\end{Prop}


\begin{Thm}
\label{thm:main3}
For every ordinal \( \alpha \), the group \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) is strongly distorted.
\end{Thm}

\begin{proof}
Let \( \{ h_n\}_{n\in\bn} \) be a sequence in \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \). 
We must find \( m \in \bn \) and a sequence \( \{ w_n\}_{n\in\bn} \) in \( \bn \), independent of \( \{h_n\} \), such that \( h_n \) is a word of length at most \( w_n \) in a subgroup generated by a subset \( S \), depending on \( \{h_n\} \), of \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) of cardinality at most \( m \). 

Fix a topological moiety \( A \).
Let us first assume that each of the \( h_n \) is supported in \( A \). 
By \Cref{lem:translation}, there exists a convergent \( A \)-translation \( \sigma \) supported in a topological moiety \( B \). 
Using \Cref{lem:translation} again, there exists a convergent \( B \)-translation \( \tau \). 
Applying \Cref{prop:construction} yields a homeomorphism \( \vp \) such that \( h_n \) can be expressed as a word of length \( 4n+4 \) in the set \( \{ \vp, \sigma, \tau \} \). 

We now assume \( \{h_n\} \) is a general sequence, but we keep \( A \), \( B \), \( \sigma \), \( \tau \), and \( \vp \) as above.
Fix a topological moiety \( C \) in \( \omega^{\alpha+1} \) such that \( A \cup C \) is a topological moiety, and using \Cref{lem:change of coordinates}, choose \( \theta \in \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \) such that \( \theta(C) = A \). 
By \Cref{prop:galvin}, we can write 
\[
h_n = h_{n,1} \circ h_{n,2} \circ h_{n,3},
\]
where either \( h_{n,i} \) or \( h_{n,i}^\theta \) is supported in \( A \). 
Therefore, by the above argument, we can write \( h_n \) as a word of length at most \( 12n+18 \) in the subgroup generated by the set \( S = \{ \sigma, \tau, \vp, \theta \} \).
Setting \( m = 4 \) and \( w_n = 12n+18 \) establishes the result.
\end{proof}

\section{Cantor--Bendixson degree greater than one}

We now turn our attention to ordinals of the form \( \omega^{\alpha+1}\cdot d +1 \), where \( d \in \bn \). 
Let us set some notations. 
Given an ordinal \( \alpha \) and \( d \in \bn \), we let:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \( X_{\alpha,d} = \omega^{\alpha+1}\cdot d + 1 \),
	\item \( \mu_k = \omega^{\alpha+1}\cdot k \in X_{\alpha,d} \) for \( 1 \leq k \leq d \),
	\item \( M_{\alpha,d} = \{\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_d\} \) be the set of maximal rank points, i.e., the rank \( \alpha+2 \) points of \( X_{\alpha,d} \), 
	\item \( N_{\alpha,d} = \{ \omega^{\alpha+1}\cdot k + \omega^\alpha \cdot \ell : k \in d, \ell \in \bn \}  \) denote the subset of next-to-maximal rank points, i.e., the rank \( \alpha + 1 \) points of \( X_{\alpha,d} \), 
	\item  \( \HH_{\alpha,d}  = \Homeo(X_{\alpha,d}) \),
	\item  \( \F_{\alpha,d} \) denote the subgroup of \( \HH_{\alpha,d} \) consisting of homeomorphisms that induce a finite permutation on the set \( N_{\alpha,d} \),
	\item  \( \overline \F_{\alpha,d} \) denote the closure of \( \F_{\alpha,d} \) in \( \HH_{\alpha,d} \), and 
	\item  \( \PH_{\alpha,d} \) denote the subgroup of \( \HH_{\alpha,d} \) fixing each of the maximal rank points.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Right-split short exact sequences}
\label{sec:ses}

The goal of this subsection is to establish two right-split exact sequences, one of the form 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:split1}
	1 \longrightarrow \overline \F_{\alpha,d} \longrightarrow \PH_{\alpha,d} \longrightarrow \bz^{d-1} \longrightarrow 1
\end{equation}
and the other of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:split2}
	1 \longrightarrow  \mathrm{\PH}_{\alpha,d} \longrightarrow \HH_{\alpha,d} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Sym}(d)\longrightarrow 1
\end{equation}
where \( \mathrm{Sym}(d) \) is the symmetric group on \( d \) letters. 

Let us first describe the homomorphism \( \PH_{\alpha,d} \to \bz^{d-1} \). 
Choose pairwise-disjoint clopen neighborhoods \( \Omega_1, \ldots, \Omega_{d-1} \) of \( \mu_1, \ldots, \mu_{d-1} \), respectively. 
Given \( h \in \PH \), let 
\[ 
	O_k(h) = \{ x \in \Omega_k \cap N : h(x) \notin \Omega_k \}
\] 
and let 
\[ 
	I_k(h) = \{ x \in N \ssm \Omega_k : h(x) \in \Omega_k \},
\]
that is, \( O_k(h) \) is the subset of \( N \) consisting of points that \( h \) moves out of \( \Omega_k \) by \( h \) and \( I_k(h) \) is the subset  consisting of points of \( N \) that \( h \) moves into \( \Omega_k \). 
As \( h \in \PH \) and as \( N \) is a discrete set whose closure is \( N \cup M \), continuity implies that \( O_k(h) \) and \( I_k(h) \) are each finite.
This allows us to define \( \chi_k \co \PH \to \bz \) by
\[
	\chi_k(h) = |O_k(h)| - |I_k(h)|. 
\]
It is readily verified that \( \chi_k \) is a homomorphism. 
We will now focus our attention on the homomorphism \( \chi_{\alpha,d} \co \PH_{\alpha,d} \to \bz^{d-1} \) given by 
\[
	\chi_{\alpha,d}(h) = \left(\chi_1(h), \ldots, \chi_{d-1}(h)\right).
\]
As with our other subscripts, we will simply write \( \chi \) when doing so does not cause confusion. 
A priori, the definition of \( \chi \) depends on our choice of \( \Omega_1, \ldots, \Omega_{d-1} \), but it turns out this is not the case; we will explain after proving Theorem~\ref{thm:ses}. 


\begin{Lem}
\label{lem:section}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( d \in \bn \ssm\{1\} \). 
The homomorphism \( \chi_{\alpha,d} \) admits a section. 
\end{Lem}

\begin{proof}
For \( i \in \{ 1, \ldots, d-1\} \), let \( Y_i = \omega^\alpha + 1 \), and let \( \overline Y_i  = (Y_i \times \bz) \cup \{ \hat \mu_i, \hat \mu_{d,i} \} \) be the two-point compactification of \( Y_i \times \bz \) where \( (y, n) \to \hat \mu_{d,i} \) as \( n \to \infty \) and \( (y,n) \to \hat \mu_i \) as \( n \to -\infty \). 
Define the homeomorphism \( \hat s_i \co \overline Y_i \to \overline Y_i \) by \( \hat s_i(y,n) = (y, n+1) \), \( \hat s_i(\hat \mu_i) = \hat \mu_i \), and \( \hat s_i( \hat \mu_{d,i}) = \hat \mu_{d,i}  \). 



Let \( Y \) be the quotient space obtained from the disjoint union of the \( \overline Y_i \) by identifying \( \hat \mu_{d,i} \) and \( \hat \mu_{d,j} \) for \( i,j \in \{1, \ldots, d-1\} \), that is, 
\[
	Y  = \left. \left(\bigsqcup_{i=1}^{d-1} \overline Y_i \right)  \middle/ \left\{ \hat \mu_{d,1}, \ldots, \hat \mu_{d,d-1} \right\} \right.
\]
Note that each of the \( \hat s_i \) descends to a homeomorphism \( s_i \co Y \to Y \).



Now, using the classification of successor ordinals, it is an exercise to show that there exists a homeomorphism \( Y \to  X \) mapping \( \hat \mu_i \) to \( \mu_i \) and the equivalence class of the \( \hat \mu_{d,i} \) to \( \mu_d \).  
Therefore, we may view the \( s_i \) as homeomorphisms of \( X \) satisfying \( s_i^n(x) \to \mu_d \) as \( n \to \infty \) and \( s_i^n(x) \to \mu_i \) as \( n \to -\infty \) for any \( x \in \supp(s_i) \ssm M \). 
By construction, the \( s_i \) pairwise commute, as the intersection of any two of their supports is a fixed point, namely \( \mu_d \).

We claim that \( \chi_i(s_i) = 1 \) and \( \chi_j(s_i) = 0 \) if \( i \neq j \). 
Let us argue the first statement.
Let \( U_i \)\footnote{We work with an arbitrary neighborhood rather than the \( \Omega_k \), as we want to  later observe that \( \chi \) does not depend on the choice of the \( \Omega_k \).} be a clopen neighborhood of \( \mu_i \) in \( Y \) disjoint from \( \mu_j \) for \( j \neq i \). 
Note that if \( j\neq i \), then \( s_i \) restricts to the identity on \( U_i \cap \overline Y_j \), allowing us to focus on  \( \widehat U_i = U_i \cap \overline Y_i \) and to work in the coordinates of \( \overline Y_i \).
Let \( N_i = \{ n \in \bz : (\omega^\alpha, n) \in \widehat U_i \} \), and let \( a = \min (\bz \ssm N_i) - 1 \). 
Let \( b \in N_i \) such that \( \hat s_i(\omega^\alpha, b) \notin \widehat U_i \).
If \( b > a \), then letting \( c = \max \{ m \in \bz \ssm N_i : m < b \} \), we have that \( \hat s_i(\omega^\alpha, c) \in \widehat U_i \). 
With the exception of \( (\omega^\alpha, a) \), we have paired each element of the form \( (\omega^\alpha, n) \in U_i \) that \( \hat s_i \) sends out of \( \widehat U_i \) with an element of the same form in the complement of \( U_i \) that \( \hat s_i \) maps into \( \widehat U_i \). 
As \( \hat s_i(\omega^\alpha, n) = (\omega^\alpha, n+1) \in \widehat U_i \) for \( m < a \) and \( \hat s_i(\omega^\alpha, a) \notin \widehat U_i \), we can conclude  that \( \chi_i(s_i) = 1 \). 
A similar line of argument can be used to establish \( \chi_j(s_i) = 0 \) whenever \( i \neq j \). 

Letting \( \{e_1, \ldots, e_{d-1} \} \) be the standard free generating set for \( \bz^{d-1} \), it follows that the map \( \bz^{d-1} \to \PH \) given by \( e_i \mapsto s_i \) is a section of \( \chi \). 
\end{proof}

To establish \eqref{eq:split1}, we now need to show that \( \overline \F \) is the kernel of \( \chi \). 
We first establish that \( \overline \F \) is contained in the kernel and then establish the converse; we split the proof into two lemmas. 

\begin{Lem}
\label{lem:in kernel}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( d \in \bn \). 
Then \( \overline \F_{\alpha,d} \) is contained in \( \ker \chi_{\alpha,d} \). 
\end{Lem}

\begin{proof}
It is an exercise to check that \( \F \) is contained in the kernel of \( \chi \). 
Now, let \( f \in \overline \F \). 
The set
\[ 
	\mathcal U := \bigcap_{k =1}^{d-1} \left\{ h \in \HH : h(\Omega_k) = f(\Omega_k) \right\} 
\]
is an open neighborhood of \( f \) in \( \HH \). 
Therefore, as \( \F \) is dense in \( \overline \F \) by definition, there exists \( g \in \mathcal U \cap \F  \).
It follows that \( (g^{-1}\circ f)(\Omega_k) = \Omega_k \) for each \( k \), implying that 
\[ 0 = \chi(g^{-1}\circ f) = \chi(f) - \chi(g) = \chi(f), \]
as \( g \in \ker \chi \).  
\end{proof}



In what follows, we let \( \Omega_d \) denote the complement of \( \Omega_1 \cup \cdots \cup \Omega_{d-1} \) in \( X_{\alpha,d} \). 

\begin{Lem}
\label{lem:factorization}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( d \in \bn \). 
If \( f \in  \ker\chi_{\alpha,d} \), then there exist homeomorphisms \( f_0, f_1, \ldots, f_d \in \overline\F_{\alpha,d} \) satisfying 
\begin{itemize}
\item \( f_0 \in \F_{\alpha,d} \),
\item \( f_k \) is supported in \( \Omega_k \) for \( k \in \{1, \ldots, d\} \), and
\item \( f = f_0 \circ f_1 \circ \cdots \circ f_d \). 
\end{itemize} 
\end{Lem}

\begin{proof}
Fix \( f \in \ker \chi \). 
As \( |O_k(f) | = | I_k(f) | \), we can choose \( g_k \in F \) such that \( g_k(f(O_k(f))) = f(I_k(f)) \),  \( g_k(f(I_k(f))) = f(O_k(f)) \), and \( g_k \) fixes every other element of \( N \). 
Let \( g = g_1 \circ \cdots \circ g_{d-1} \), so that \( (g\circ f) (\Omega_k \cap N) = \Omega_k \cap N \) for all \( k \). 
 
Choose \( f_k \in \PH \) supported in \( \Omega_k \) such that \( f_k \) induces the same permutation of \( \Omega_k \cap N \) as does \( g \circ f \). 
It follows that \[ h = g \circ f \circ f_d^{-1} \circ \cdots \circ f_{1}^{-1} \]
induces a trivial permutation on \( N \); in particular, \( h \in \F \). 
Setting \( f_0 = g^{-1} \circ h \) yields the factorization \( f = f_0 \circ f_1 \circ \cdots f_d \) with \( f_0 \in \F \) and \( f_k \) supported in \( \Omega_k \) for \( k > 0 \).
It is left to verify that each of the \( f_k \) is in \( \overline F \). 

Let \( G_k \) denote the subgroup of \(  \PH \) consisting of elements supported in \( \Omega_k \). 
Note that \( f_k \in G_k \). 
We can identify \( G_k \) with \( \Homeo(\Omega_k) \), and as \( \Omega_k \) is homeomorphic to \( \omega^{\alpha+1} + 1 \) by \Cref{lem:stable}, we can apply \Cref{cor:max subgroup} to see that \( G_k \cap \overline F = G_k \), allowing us to conclude that \( f_k \in \overline F \), as desired. 
\end{proof}


\begin{Thm}
\label{thm:ses}
	Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( d \in \bn \ssm\{1\} \). 
	
	\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	
		\item There exists a homomorphism \( \chi \co \PH_{\alpha,d} \to \bz^{d-1} \) such that 
				\[
					1 \longrightarrow \overline \F_{\alpha,d} \lhook\joinrel\longrightarrow \PH_{\alpha,d} \overset{\chi}\longrightarrow \bz^{d-1} \longrightarrow 1
				\]
				is a short exact sequence and it is right split. 
				
			\item If \( \Phi \co \HH_{\alpha,d} \to \Sym(M_{\alpha,d} ) \) is the canonical action, then the short exact sequence 
				\[
					1 \longrightarrow  \PH_{\alpha,d} \lhook\joinrel\longrightarrow \HH_{\alpha,d} \overset{\Phi}\longrightarrow \Sym(M_{\alpha,d}) \longrightarrow 1
				\]
				is right split.
				
		\end{enumerate}
		
\end{Thm}

\begin{proof}
For (1), we have already established the section to \( \chi \) in \Cref{lem:section}; in \Cref{lem:in kernel}, we showed that \( \overline \F \) is in \( \ker \chi \). 
It is left to show that \( \ker \chi \) is in \( \overline \F \). 
Let \( f \in \ker \chi \).
Then \Cref{lem:factorization} implies \( f = f_0 \circ f_1 \circ \cdots \circ f_k \) with \( f_0 \in \F \) and \( f_k \) supported in \( \Omega_k \). 
Let \( G_k \) denote the subgroup of \(  \PH \) consisting of elements supported in \( \Omega_k \). 
We can identify \( G_k \) with \( \Homeo(\Omega_k) \), and as \( \Omega_k \) is homeomorphic to \( \omega^{\alpha+1} + 1 \) by \Cref{lem:stable}, we can apply \Cref{cor:max subgroup} to see that \( G_k \cap \overline \F = G_k \), allowing us to conclude that \( f_k \in \overline \F \), as desired.
This establishes (1). 

We move to the second sequence, which is exact by definition; we must show that it is right split.
Let \( J_1 = \{ x \in X_{\alpha,d}: x \leq \mu_1 \} \) and, for \( k \in \{2, \ldots, d\} \), let \( J_k = \{ x \in X_{\alpha,d} : \mu_{k-1} < x \leq \mu_k \} \). 
Given \( j,k \in \{ 1, \ldots, d\} \), there is a unique order-preserving bijection \( g_{j,k} \co J_j \to J_k \). 
Using our enumeration of \( M \), identify \( \Sym(M) \) with \( \Sym\left(\{1, \ldots, d\}\right) \). 
Taking \( \sigma \in \Sym(M) \), define \( \Psi(\sigma) \in \HH \) to be the homeomorphism  given by
\[
	\Psi(\sigma)(x) =  g_{k,\sigma(k)}(x),
\]
whenever \( x \in J_k \). 
Then \( \Psi \) is a section of \( \Phi \), finishing the proof. 
\end{proof}

Before continuing, let us come back to noting that the definition of \( \chi \) did not depend on the choice of the \( \Omega_k \).
Suppose a different choice is made resulting in a homomorphism \( \chi' \).
A careful reading of the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:section} shows that \( \chi \) and \( \chi' \) share a section.
Moreover, Theorem~\ref{thm:ses} applies to \( \chi' \), so that \( \chi \) and \( \chi' \) have the same kernel.
Together, these facts imply that \( \chi = \chi' \). 


\subsection{Properties of \( \overline \F_{0,d} \)}

Given \Cref{thm:ses}, it is clear that we need to understand the structure of \( \overline \F \) in order to understand the structure of \( \PH \) and \( \HH \).
Unfortunately, the subgroup \( \F \) gets in the way of our strategies.
We have the tools to investigate the quotient \( \overline \F_{\alpha,d} / \F_{\alpha,d} \), but unfortunately this quotient is independent of \( \alpha \); in particular, this quotient group is isomorphic to \( \overline \F_{0,d} \). 
Because of this, we now limit our focus to \( \overline \F_{0,d} \). 


The key idea is to use fragmentation to reduce statements about \( \overline \F_{0,d} \) to statements about \( \Homeo(\omega) \). 
Using \Cref{lem:in kernel} together with \Cref{lem:factorization} and the fact that the choices of the \( \Omega_k \) above were arbitrary, we obtain the following version of \Cref{lem:factorization} that is well suited to our purposes.

\begin{Lem}[Fragmentation in \( \overline \F_{\alpha,d} \)]
\label{lem:factorization2}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( d \in \bn \). 
If \( f \in \overline \F_{\alpha,d} \), then for any pairwise-disjoint clopen neighborhoods \( U_1, \ldots, U_d \) of \( \mu_1, \ldots, \mu_d \), respectively, there exist homeomorphisms \( f_0, f_1, \ldots, f_d \) such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item \( f_0 \in \F_{\alpha,d} \),
\item \( f_i \) is supported in \( U_i \) for \( i \in \{1, \ldots, d\} \), and
\item \( f = f_0 \circ f_1 \circ \cdots \circ f_d \). 
\qed
\end{itemize}
\end{Lem}


We stated the fragmentation lemma for general \( \alpha \), but it is particularly useful for \( \alpha =1 \), as in this case \( \F_{0,d} \) is the subgroup of finitely supported homeomorphisms. 

\begin{Lem}
\label{lem:local isom}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( d \in \bn \).
If \( U \) is a clopen neighborhood of \( \mu \in M \) such that \( U \cap M = \{\mu\} \), then the subgroup of \( \overline \F_{\alpha,d} \) consisting of homeomorphisms supported in \( U \) is isomorphic to \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \). 
\end{Lem}

\begin{proof}
Let \( G \) denote the subgroup of \( \overline \F_{\alpha,d} \) consisting of elements supported in \( U \). 
We can then identify \( G \) with a subgroup of \( \Homeo(U) \). 
By \Cref{lem:stable}, \( U \) is homeomorphic to \( X_{\alpha,1} \), and hence as  \( G \) contains an element inducing an infinite permutation on the set \( N_{\alpha,d} \), Theorem~\ref{thm:normal generators 1} implies \( G \) is isomorphic to \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \). 
\end{proof}


\Cref{lem:factorization2} and \Cref{lem:local isom} imply that \( \overline \F_{\alpha,d} / \F_{\alpha,d} \) can be realized as quotient of \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1})^d \), and hence this quotient is strongly distorted and uniformly perfect. 
In the case of uniform perfectness, the difficulty is then understanding whether we can express the elements of \( \F_{\alpha,d} \) as products of commutators of elements in \( \overline \F_{\alpha,d} \).
Unfortunately, we cannot answer this question in general, but we can do so for \( \alpha = 0 \). 

\begin{Thm}
\label{thm:perfect F}
If \( d \in \bn\ssm \{1\} \), then \( \overline \F_{0,d} \) is uniformly perfect of commutator width at most four. 
\end{Thm}

\begin{proof}
Fix \( f \in \overline \F_{0,d} \). 
Let \( U_1, \ldots, U_d \) be pairwise-disjoint clopen neighborhoods of \( \mu_1, \ldots, \mu_d \), respectively.
By \Cref{lem:factorization2}, we can write \( f= f_0 \circ f_1 \circ \cdots \circ f_d \) with \( f_0 \in \F \) and \( f_i \) supported in \( U_i \) for \( i > 0 \). 
Combining \Cref{lem:local isom} and \Cref{thm:mainthm2}, we can write \( f_i = [g_{i,1}, h_{i,1}][g_{i,2},h_{i,2}][g_{i,3},h_{i,3}] \) with \( g_{i,j} \) and \( h_{i,j} \) supported in \( U_i \) for \( i > 1 \).
Observe that if group elements \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \) are such that \( a \) and \( b \) both commute with each of \( c \) and \( d \), then \( [a,b][c,d] = [ac,bd] \). 
It follows that \( f_1 \circ \cdots \circ f_d \)  can be expressed a product of three commutators. 
To finish, observe that as the support of \( f_0 \) is finite, we can conjugate \( f_0 \) to have support in \( U _1 \), allowing us to apply \Cref{lem:commutator} to express \( f_0 \) as a commutator.
Therefore, \( f \) is a product of four commutators, as desired. 
\end{proof}



We now turn to classifying the normal generators of \( \overline \F_{0,d} \). 
Given \( Z \subset M_{0,d} \), let \( \F_Z \) denote the subgroup of \( \overline \F_{0,d} \) consisting of homeomorphisms that restrict to the identity in an open neighborhood of each point of \( Z \).
Given a subgroup \( \Gamma \) of \( \overline \F_{0,d} \), we let \( Z_\Gamma \) be the subset of \( M_{0,d} \) consisting of the \( \mu \in M_{0,d} \) such that for each \( g \in \Gamma \) there is an open neighborhood \( U \) of \( \mu \) that is fixed pointwise by \( g \), that is, \( Z_\Gamma \) is the largest subset of \( M_{0,d} \) satisftying \( \F_{Z_\Gamma} < \Gamma \). 
For \( f \in \overline \F_{0,d} \), we write \( Z_f \) to denote \( Z_{\langle f \rangle} \). 


\begin{Thm}
\label{thm:normal generators 2}
Let \( d \in \bn \ssm\{1\} \), and let \( \Gamma \) be a normal subgroup of \( \overline \F_{0,d} \).
If \( \Gamma \) is not contained in \( \F_{0,d} \), then  \( \F_{Z_\Gamma} = \Gamma \).
Moreover, (1) there exists \( \gamma \in \Gamma \) such that \( Z_\gamma = Z_\Gamma \), and (2) if \( \gamma \in \Gamma \) such that \( Z_\gamma = Z_\Gamma \), then \( \gamma \) uniformly normally generates \( \Gamma \). 
\end{Thm}

\begin{proof}
By assumption, \( \Gamma \) is a normal subgroup of \( \overline \F \) not contained in \( \F \), and therefore, \( Z_\Gamma \neq M \). 
As the elements of \( N_{0,d} \) are isolated, it follows that \( \Gamma < F_{Z_\Gamma} \), so we need only show that \( F_{Z_\Gamma} < \Gamma \). 

First, we claim that if \( \mu \in M \ssm Z_\Gamma \), then there exists a clopen neighborhood \( U_\mu \) of \( \mu \) and an element \( g_\mu \) in \( \Gamma \) supported in \( U_\mu \) such that \( U_\mu \cap M = \{\mu\} \) and such that \( g_\mu \) induces an infinite permutation on \( N \cap U_\mu \). 
Fix \( \mu \in M \ssm Z_\Gamma \), and choose \( g \in \Gamma \) such that \( g \) induces a nontrivial permutation on \( U \cap N \) for every open neighborhood \( U \) of \( \mu \). 
By continuity, we can choose pairwise-disjoint clopen neighborhoods \( U_1, \ldots, U_d \) of \( \mu_1, \ldots, \mu_d \), respectively, such that \( g(U_i) \cap U_j = \varnothing \) whenever \( j \neq k \). 
Applying \Cref{lem:factorization2} to \( g \) allows us to write \( g = g_0 \circ g_1 \circ \cdots \circ g_d \) with \( g_0 \in \F \) and  with \( g_i \in \overline \F \) supported in \( U_i \).

Let \( k \in \{1, \ldots, d\} \) be such that \( \mu = \mu_k \). 
By \Cref{lem:displacement}, there exists an infinite subset \( A \) of \( N \cap U_k \) such that \( g_k(A) \cap A = \varnothing \).
By shrinking \( A \) we may assume that \( A \) is disjoint from the support of \( g_0 \). 
Let \( \tau \) be the involution such that \( \tau|_A = g_k|_A \), \( \tau|_{g_k(A)} = g_k^{-1}|_{g_k(A)} \),  and such that \( \tau \) is the identity on the complement of \( A \cup g_k(A) \). 
It follows that \( [\tau, g_0g_k] \)  induces an infinite permutation on \( U_k \cap N \), and 
\begin{align*}
	[\tau, g]	&= \tau \circ g \circ \tau^{-1} \circ g^{-1}  \\
			&= g_0^\tau \circ g_k^\tau \circ g_k^{-1} \circ g_0^{-1} \\
			&= [\tau, g_0g_k]
\end{align*}
The first equality implies that \( [\tau,g] \in \Gamma \), and the second equality is deduced from the fact that \( \tau \) commutes with each \( g_i \) for \( i > 0 \) and \( i \neq k \). 
As \( \tau \) is supported in \( U_k \), it follows from the second equality that \( [\tau,g] \) restricts to the identity on the complement of \( g_0(U_k) \), i.e., \( [\tau,g] \) is supported in \( g_0(U_k) \). 
Setting \( g_\mu = [\tau, g] \) and \( U_\mu = g_0(U_k) \), establishes the claim. 


Let \( G_\mu \) denote the subgroup of \( \overline \F \) consisting of elements supported in \( U_\mu \). 
\Cref{lem:local isom} implies that \( G_\mu \) is isomorphic to \( \Homeo(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \). 
In particular, \Cref{thm:normal generators 1} implies that \( g_\mu \) uniformly normally generates \( G_\mu \). 
Moreover, as \( g_\mu \in \Gamma \) and \( \Gamma \) is normal, we have that \( G_\mu < \Gamma \). 


Now, fix \( f \in \F_{Z_\Gamma} \). 
Again applying \Cref{lem:factorization2}, we can write \( f = f_0 \circ \prod_{\mu \in M \ssm Z_\Gamma} f_\mu \) with \( f_0 \in \F \) and each \( f_\mu \in \overline \F \) supported in \( U_\mu \).
It follows that there exist \( w \in \overline \F_{0,d} \) such that \( f \circ w = f_0 \in \F \) and such that \( w \) can be expressed as a product of \( 12 |M \ssm Z_\Gamma| \) elements from the set \( \{ g_\mu, g_\mu^{-1} :  \mu \in M \ssm Z_\Gamma \} \) and their conjugates (the number twelve comes from the proof of \Cref{thm:normal generators 1}). 
In particular, \( w \in \Gamma \). 
It is left to check that \( f_0 \in \Gamma \). 
As \( f_0 \in \F_{0,d} \) has finite support, there is a conjugate of \( f_0 \) supported in \( U_{\mu_1} \). 
\Cref{prop:anderson} implies that \( f_0 \) can be written as a product of four conjugates of \( g_{\mu_1} \) and \( g_{\mu_1}^{-1} \).
Therefore, \( F_{Z_\Gamma} < \Gamma \), as desired.

To finish, let \( \gamma \in \Gamma \) be such that \( Z_\gamma = Z_\Gamma \).  
First note that such a \( \gamma \) exists: the product of the \( g_\mu \) constructed above is such a \( \gamma \). 
We can now run the entirety of the argument above with \( g = \gamma \).
Then, by construction, each of the \( g_\mu \) is a product of a conjugate of \( \gamma \) and \( \gamma^{-1} \); the result follows. 
\end{proof}

We can now readily deduce a classification of the normal generators of \( \overline \F_{0,d} \). 

\begin{Thm}[Normal generators for \( \overline \F_{0,d} \)]
\label{thm:normal generators F}
Let \( d \in \bn \). 
For \( f \in \overline\F_{0,d} \), the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \( f \) normally generates \( \overline\F_{0,d} \).
	\item \( f \) uniformly normally generates \( \overline\F_{0,d} \).
	\item \( Z_f = \varnothing \). 
	\item \( f \) induces an infinite permutation of the set \( \{ \omega\cdot k + \ell : \ell \in \bn \} \) for each \( k \in d \). 
\end{enumerate}
\end{Thm}

\begin{proof}
The implications (ii) to (i), (i) to (iv), and (iv) to (iii) are immediate.  
The implication (iii) to (ii) follows from \Cref{thm:normal generators 2} by setting \( \Gamma = \overline \F_{0,d} \) and \( \gamma = f \).
\end{proof}



\subsection{Properties of \( \PH_{0,d} \) and \( \HH_{0,d} \)}

In light of the short exact sequences in \Cref{thm:ses}, we can build on the uniform perfectness of and the classification of normal generators for \( \overline \F_{0,d} \) to compute the abelianization of and construct minimal normal generating sets for each of \( \PH_{0,d} \) and \( \HH_{0,d} \). 


\begin{Thm}[Abelianization]
\label{thm:abelianization}

	If \( d \in \bn\ssm\{1\} \), then:
    
    	\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    	
    		\item The abelianization of \( \PH_{0,d} \) is isomorphic to \( \bz^{d-1} \).
    		
    		\item The abelianization of \( \HH_{0,d} \) is isomorphic to \( \bz/2\bz \times \bz/2\bz \).
    		
    	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{Thm}

\begin{proof}


By \Cref{thm:ses}, we know \( \PH_{0,d} \cong \overline \F_{0,d} \rtimes \bz^{d-1} \), and by \Cref{thm:perfect F} that \( \overline\F_{0,d} \) is  perfect, so that the abelianization of \( \PH_{0,d} \) is \( \bz^{d-1} \). 
For \( \HH_{0,d} \), again as \( \overline\F_{0,d} \) is perfect, the abelianization of \( \HH_{0,d} \) factors through the abelianization of \( \bz^{d-1} \rtimes \Sym(d) \), where we are using \Cref{thm:ses} for the semi-direct product decomposition. 
We will do the computation through a presentation.  
Let \( s_1, \ldots, s_{d-1} \) be the shift homeomorphisms from the proof of \Cref{lem:section}, and let \( e_i \) be the projection of \( s_i \) under the quotient map \( \HH_{0,d} \to \bz^{d-1} \rtimes \Sym(d) \).
It follows that \( \{e_1, \ldots, e_{d-1} \} \) is a  free generating set for \( \bz^{d-1} \).
If we let \( \tau_i \in \Sym(d) \) denote the transposition of \( i \) and \( i +1 \), then building off a standard presentation for the symmetric group,  a presentation for \( \bz^{d-1} \rtimes \Sym(d) \) is given by 
\[
	\left\{ e_1, \ldots, e_{d-1}, \tau_1, \ldots, \tau_{d-1} :
	\begin{array}{ll}
		\tau_i^2 = 1 & \\ 
		{[e_i,e_j]} = 1 &  \\
		{[\tau_i,\tau_j] = 1} & \text{if } |i-j| > 1 \\
		\tau_i\tau_j\tau_i = \tau_j\tau_i\tau_j & \text{if } |i-j| = 1 \\
		{[\tau_i, e_j] = 1} & \text{if } i \neq j, j+1 \\
		\tau_i e_i \tau_i^{-1} = e_{i+1}   & \text{if } i \neq d-1\\
		\tau_i e_{i+1} \tau_i^{-1} = e_i & \text{if } i \neq d-1\\
		\tau_{d-1} e_{d-1} \tau_{d-1} = -e_{d-1} &
	\end{array} \right\}
\]
To compute the abelianization, we add the commutator relation for each generator.
Letting \( \pi \) denote the canonical homomorphism to the abelianization, we see that \( \pi(\tau_i) = \pi(\tau_j) \), \( \pi(e_i) = \pi(e_j) \), and \( \pi(e_i) = -\pi(e_i) \). 
It follows that the abelianization is generated by two commuting order two elements and is therefore isomorphic to \( \bz/2\bz \times \bz/2\bz \). 
\end{proof}


\begin{Thm}[Minimal cardinality for normal generating set]
\label{thm:cardinality}
Let \( \alpha \) be an ordinal, and let \( d \in \bn \). 
The minimal cardinality for a normal generating set of \( \PH_{0,d} \) is \( d-1 \) and is two for \( \HH_{0,d} \). 
\end{Thm}

\begin{proof}
Let us first consider \( \PH_{0,d} \). 
First note that, by \Cref{thm:abelianization}, the cardinality of any normal generating set for \( \PH_{0,d} \) must be at least \( d-1 \), as it projects to a generating set for \( \bz^{d-1} \).
So, we need only find a normal generating set of cardinality of \( d-1 \); to this end, let \( S = \{s_1, \ldots, s_{d-1} \} \), where the \( s_i \) are the shift homeomorphisms constructed in the proof of \Cref{lem:section}. 
We can then label the elements of \( N \) as \( \{ (n,i) : n \in \bn, 1 \leq i \leq d-1 \} \) in such a way that \( s_i(n,i) = (n+1,i) \) and \( s_i(n,j) = (n,j) \) whenever \( j \neq i \). 
Let \( s = s_1\circ s_2 \circ \cdots \circ s_{d-1} \). 
Choose \( t \in \PH_{0,d} \) such that \( t(2n,i) = (2n+1,i) \) and \( t(2n+1,i) = (2n,i) \). 
Then \( s^t(2n,i) = (2n+3,i) \) and \( s^t(2n+1,i) = (2n, i) \). 
In particular,
\[
	[t,s](2n+1,i) = (2n+3,i) \text{ and } [t,s](2n,i) = (2n-2,i) 
\]
It follows that \( [t,s] \in \overline \F_{0,d} \) and \( Z_{[t,s]} = \varnothing \); therefore, \( [t,s] \) normally generates \( \overline\F_{0,d} \) by \Cref{thm:normal generators F}. 
By \Cref{thm:ses}, \( \PH_{0,d} \) is the semi-direct product of \( \overline \F_{0,d} \) and the subgroup generated by \( S \), and hence \( S  \) is a normal generating set for \( \PH_{0,d} \). 

Turning to \( \HH_{0,d} \), \Cref{thm:abelianization} tells us that a normal generating set for \( \HH_{0,d} \) must have cardinality at least two.
The group \( \Sym(d) \) is normally generated by a single element (e.g., if \( d\neq 4 \), then every odd permutation is a normal generator). 
Let \( h \in \HH_{0,d} \) such that the induced permutation of \( h \) on \( \Sym(M) \) normally generates \( \Sym(M) \). 
Let \( s_1, \ldots, s_{d-1} \) and \( s \) be as above. 
Observe that \( s_i \) and \( s_j \) are conjugate in \( \HH_{0,d} \); in particular, \( s \) is a product of conjugates of \( s_1 \). 
Therefore, from above, we see that \( \PH_{0,d} \) is in the group normally generated by \( s_1 \) in \( \HH_{0,d} \). 
By \Cref{thm:ses}, \( \HH_{0,d} \) is isomorphic to \( \PH_{0,d} \rtimes \Sym(M) \), implying \( \{s_1, h\} \) is a normal generating set for \( \HH_{0,d} \).
