# Galvin's Lemma for Ordinals

This file proves Galvin's lemma for homeomorphism groups of ordinals, which provides
a uniform fragmentation result for homeomorphisms in terms of moieties.

## Main results

* `galvin_lemma`: Every homeomorphism can be written as a product of three homeomorphisms,
  each supported in one of two disjoint moieties

This is a key technical tool for proving uniform perfectness and characterizing normal generators.
