# Uniform Perfectness of Homeomorphism Groups

This file proves that Homeo(ω^(α+1)) is uniformly perfect with commutator width at most 3.

## Main definitions

* `UniformlyPerfect`: A group where every element is a bounded product of commutators
* `commutatorWidth`: The minimal number of commutators needed

## Main results

* `moiety_supported_is_commutator`: Elements supported in moieties are single commutators
* `homeo_uniformly_perfect`: Homeo(ω^(α+1)) has commutator width at most 3

## References

* [Bhat et al., Algebraic and geometric properties of homeomorphism groups of ordinals]

  -- The key idea: use a convergent A-translation τ
  -- Then σ = ∏_{n=0}^∞ (τⁿ ∘ h ∘ τ⁻ⁿ) satisfies h = [σ, τ]
  
  -- Get a convergent A-translation
  obtain ⟨τ, hτ_trans, hτ_moiety⟩ := exists_convergent_translation A
  
  -- Define σ as the infinite product
  -- For each compact set K, only finitely many terms are non-identity on K
  -- This ensures the infinite product converges in the compact-open topology
  
  -- The proof that h = [σ, τ] follows from the standard commutator trick:
  -- σ = h · (τhτ⁻¹) · (τ²hτ⁻²) · ...
  -- στ = (τhτ⁻¹) · (τ²hτ⁻²) · ...
  -- So στσ⁻¹ = h⁻¹ · σ · τ = h⁻¹ · (τhτ⁻¹) · (τ²hτ⁻²) · ... 
  -- Therefore στσ⁻¹τ⁻¹ = h⁻¹
  
  -- For now, we use sorry as this requires:
  -- 1. Proper construction of infinite products in topological groups
  -- 2. The convergent translation existence theorem from Moiety.lean
