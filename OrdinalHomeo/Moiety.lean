# Topological Moieties

This file defines topological moieties for ordinals of the form œâ^(Œ±+1) and proves their
key properties used in the proofs about homeomorphism groups.

## Main definitions

* `TopologicalMoiety`: A clopen subset of œâ^(Œ±+1) that contains infinitely many rank Œ±+1 points
  and whose complement also contains infinitely many rank Œ±+1 points
* `ATranslation`: A homeomorphism œÜ such that œÜ‚Åø(A) are pairwise disjoint for all n ‚àà ‚Ñ§
* `ConvergentATranslation`: An A-translation where {œÜ‚Åø(A)} is locally finite

## Main results

* Every topological moiety is homeomorphic to œâ^(Œ±+1)
* For any two disjoint moieties, there exists an involution swapping them
* Every moiety admits a convergent translation

## References

* [Bhat et al., Algebraic and geometric properties of homeomorphism groups of ordinals]
