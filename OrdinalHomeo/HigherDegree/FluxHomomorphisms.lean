# Flux Homomorphisms

This file provides the detailed construction of the flux homomorphisms χ_k
that measure the movement of next-to-maximal rank elements in and out of
neighborhoods of maximal rank elements.

## Main Definitions

* `O_k` - The set of elements moved out of Ω_k by a homeomorphism
* `I_k` - The set of elements moved into Ω_k by a homeomorphism
* `flux_homomorphism` - The homomorphism χ_k : PH_{α,d} → ℤ
* `shift_homeomorphism` - The shift homeomorphisms s_i that provide a section

theorem O_k_finite (k : Fin (d - 1)) (Ω : Fin (d - 1) → Set (X α d))
  (h : PH α d) : (O_k k Ω h).Finite := by
  -- O_k consists of elements of nextToMaximalRankElements that h moves out of Ω k
  -- Since h ∈ PH, it fixes maximal rank elements
  -- The key is that h is continuous and nextToMaximalRankElements is discrete
  -- This means h can only move finitely many elements of nextToMaximalRankElements
  
  -- The set O_k is a subset of nextToMaximalRankElements
  have h_sub : O_k k Ω h ⊆ nextToMaximalRankElements α d := by

  -- Key insight: In ordinal topology, nextToMaximalRankElements is discrete
  -- Each point n ∈ nextToMaximalRankElements has a clopen neighborhood containing only n
  -- from nextToMaximalRankElements (though it may contain lower rank points)
  
  -- Since h is continuous and fixes all maximal rank elements,
  -- for each maximal rank element μ, h maps some neighborhood of μ to a neighborhood of μ
  -- The only elements of nextToMaximalRankElements that can be moved by h
  -- are those in a bounded region near the maximal rank elements
  
  -- Proof sketch:
  -- 1. Show nextToMaximalRankElements has discrete subspace topology
  -- 2. Use continuity of h at maximal rank points (which are fixed)
  -- 3. Conclude only finitely many next-to-maximal rank elements can be moved
  
  sorry -- Requires: ordinal topology theory and analysis of discrete subspaces

theorem I_k_finite (k : Fin (d - 1)) (Ω : Fin (d - 1) → Set (X α d))
  (h : PH α d) : (I_k k Ω h).Finite := by
  -- Similar to O_k_finite: I_k consists of elements moved into Ω k
  -- The argument is symmetric to O_k_finite

  -- The flux is the net flow: |I_k| - |O_k|
  -- We need to establish a canonical choice of neighborhoods Ω
  let _Ω := standard_neighborhoods α d
  -- Since O_k and I_k are finite (by the theorems above), we can count their elements
  -- For now, return 0 as a placeholder
  0  -- Placeholder: should be |I_k| - |O_k|
