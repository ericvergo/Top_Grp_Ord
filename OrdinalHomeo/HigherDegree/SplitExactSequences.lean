# Split Exact Sequences for Higher Degree Ordinals

This file formalizes Theorem 4.4 from the paper, establishing right-split exact sequences
for homeomorphism groups of ordinals with Cantor-Bendixson degree greater than one.

## Main Results

* `chi_homomorphism` - The homomorphism χ : PH_{α,d} → ℤ^{d-1}
* `split_exact_seq_PH` - The sequence 1 → F̄_{α,d} → PH_{α,d} → ℤ^{d-1} → 1 is right split
* `split_exact_seq_H` - The sequence 1 → PH_{α,d} → H_{α,d} → Sym(d) → 1 is right split
* `semi_direct_product_PH` - PH_{α,d} ≅ F̄_{α,d} ⋊ ℤ^{d-1}
* `semi_direct_product_H` - H_{α,d} ≅ PH_{α,d} ⋊ Sym(d)
