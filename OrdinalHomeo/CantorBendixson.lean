# Cantor-Bendixson Rank and Degree

This file defines the Cantor-Bendixson derivative, rank, and degree for topological spaces,
with special focus on ordinals equipped with their order topology.

## Main definitions

* `derivedSet`: The derived set (set of accumulation points)
* `CantorBendixsonDerivative`: The α-th Cantor-Bendixson derivative
* `CantorBendixsonRank`: The least ordinal α such that the α-th derivative is empty
* `CantorBendixsonDegree`: The cardinality of the final non-empty derivative
* `rank`: The rank of a point in a space

## Main results

* The CB rank of a successor ordinal is the successor of its limit capacity
* The CB degree of a successor ordinal is its coefficient
* Classification of successor ordinals by CB rank and degree

## References

* [Bhat et al., Algebraic and geometric properties of homeomorphism groups of ordinals]
